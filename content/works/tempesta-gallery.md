## The Challenge

Tempesta is a multilingual **art gallery website** designed to showcase artists, exhibitions, and artworks to a global audience. The objective was to devise a visually appealing, user-friendly, and content-rich platform that supports **multiple languages** and is optimized for both users and search engines. The implementation of a **customized taxonomy framework** facilitates the organization and categorization of artists, exhibitions, and their respective bodies of work.

## My Role

As the lead developer and designer, I was responsible for the conceptualization, design, and execution of the project's visual identity. The responsibilities of the position entailed requirements gathering, technical architecture, UI/UX design, frontend and backend development, and deployment. In addition, the role encompassed the management of content integration and the assurance of accessibility and performance best practices.

## The Process

- Requirements analysis with stakeholders to define goals and content structure
- User research to understand the needs of art enthusiasts and gallery visitors
- Wireframing and prototyping layouts using Figma
- Iterative development with Eleventy (11ty) static site generator for fast, secure, and maintainable code
- Implementation of multilingual support and dynamic navigation
- User testing and feedback sessions to refine usability
- Deployment to Netlify with continuous integration

## The Outcome

The final website is a fast, accessible, and visually appealing platform that increased online engagement by 40% within the first three months. The gallery's multilingual support expanded its reach to international audiences, and the modular content structure facilitated the team's ability to update exhibitions and artist profiles.
