### The Outcome

The final website boasts a comprehensive product catalog, educational resources, and a streamlined checkout process. The website loads rapidly, achieves high rankings for targeted keywords, and has exhibited a quantifiable increase in organic traffic and sales. For instance, following the implementation of the aforementioned strategy, there was a 40% increase in organic traffic and a 25% improvement in conversion rates.
An additional website, containing a Japanese glossary, was developed for cross-linking purposes.
