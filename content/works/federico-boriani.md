## The Challenge

The objective is to create a professional website for Federico Boriani Studio that will clearly communicate **the value of user-centered information architecture and UX design**. The objective of this initiative was threefold: first, to establish a transparent process; second, to showcase the organization's expertise; and third, to provide useful resources for clients and colleagues.

## My Role

The scope of my responsibility encompassed the entirety of the development process, including the translation of design concepts into prototypes and the subsequent optimization of performance and accessibility. The tasks entrusted to me included the construction of the site's structural framework, the incorporation of SVG icons, the implementation of modular content sections, and the adherence to SEO best practices.

## The Process

- **Content Analysis:** Collaborated with the client to understand key messages and user needs.
- **Component-Based Development:** Built reusable sections for process and resources using Eleventy and Nunjucks.
- **SVG Integration:** Automated SVG icon usage for visual consistency.
- **Performance & Accessibility:** Optimized images, ensured semantic HTML, and validated accessibility.
- **Testing:** Cross-browser and device testing to guarantee a seamless user experience.

## The Outcome

The website offers a lucid and accessible presentation of the studio's methodology and expertise. The platform's modular design facilitates straightforward updates and technical optimizations, leading to enhanced performance metrics such as expedited load times and augmented accessibility. The site has contributed to increased engagement and positive feedback from both clients and peers.
