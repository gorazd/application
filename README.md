## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorazd/application.git
cd application
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

## Deployment

The site is configured for deployment on Netlify and includes:
- Automatic builds on push
- 404 page handling
- Environment-specific builds

## Navigation Performance Optimization

Implemented a multi-phase SPA-like navigation system focused on reducing perceived and actual navigation latency:

- Performance marks (nav-start/nav-end) with Long Task observation.
- Overlapped fetch + exit transition; removed fixed artificial delays.
- In-memory HTML cache + pointerenter/focus prefetch (80ms debounce).
- Idempotent animations: single import + reinit only, heavy animation work deferred with `requestIdleCallback` fallback.
- Progressive enhancement using View Transitions API with custom CSS fallback transitions.
- Concurrency guard via `AbortController` preventing overlapping fetches and ignoring redundant same-path clicks.
- Class-based page-enter/page-exit transitions to avoid inline style thrash.
- Sanitation/helpers reducing duplicated DOM queries and origin checks.
- Diagnostic utilities: `__navMetrics()` (quick stats) and `__navSummary()` (median, p95, mean, heuristic cache hit ratio).

Enhancements (Post-Phases):
- Cache TTL & LRU: in-memory cache capped (`NAV_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`=20) with 5â€‘minute TTL (`NAV_CACHE_TTL_MS`). Expired or leastâ€‘recently used entries are evicted automatically.
- Optâ€‘out attribute: add `data-no-spa` on any `<a>` to force a full page load (skips interception & prefetch).
- Performance budgets: configurable runtime budgets with warnings when exceeded.

Runtime Diagnostics & APIs (open DevTools Console):
```js
__navMetrics();        // Quick count/median/p95 summary
__navSummary();        // Collapsed console table summary
__navExport();         // Detailed per-navigation records (path, duration, cached, longTasks)
__setNavBudgets({      // Update performance budget thresholds
	warnMedian: 320,
	warnP95: 800,
	warnLongTasks: 2
});
// Current budgets available at window.__navBudgets
```

Performance Budgets (defaults):
- Median warning: 350ms
- P95 warning: 900ms
- Long Tasks per navigation: >3

When a threshold is exceeded a `[nav-budget]` warning logs with context.

Rollback: checkout a pre-optimization tag (create one before merging, e.g. `git tag pre-nav-optimization`) or remove SPA init & related instrumentation blocks in `public/js/main.js`.

Future Opportunities:
- Persist navigation metrics to a JSON artifact for CI diffing.
- Lighthouse CI integration with budgets (TBT, CLS, LCP targets).
- Add `data-preload` hint to elevate priority of specific prefetch routes.
- Service Worker layer for offline cache & staleâ€‘whileâ€‘revalidate.
