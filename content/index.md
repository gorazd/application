## Qualifications 

Developing projects from pixels to production while collaborating effectively with various studios and agencies.
With over 20 years of front-end development experience, I have built expertise across the full spectrum of **web technologies** and **user interface design**. I currently serve as a front-end instructor at SPD, where I teach modern development practices while continuing to work on client projects and staying current with evolving industry standards.

## Guiding Principles

To grow, I learn, update, expand, and edit my identity. Starting with a solid design I subject everything to human review. When writing code I don't vibe code but use the AI as a pair programmer, or a powerful tool in my engineering toolkit.

## Beyond the Pixels

Art and design, nature and science. There is a wide range of things that fascinate and appeal to me.
