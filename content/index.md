## UX/UI Designer

With over a decade of experience shaping user-centric mobile applications, I am a passionate UX/UI designer with a proven track record of delivering intuitive and engaging user experiences. My background in front-end development allows me to bridge the gap between design and engineering, ensuring seamless and efficient implementation.

I am particularly drawn to Bending Spoons' innovative approach to acquiring and scaling digital products. I am confident that my skills in data-driven design, user research, and creating scalable design systems would be a valuable asset to your team.

This website serves as a small token of my interest in the UX/UI Designer position at Bending Spoons. Here you can find my cover letter, CV, and portfolio.
