# Dear Bending Spoons,

*Milano, 28.08.2025*

**Subject: Application for the UX/UI Designer Position**

Dear Hiring Team at Bending Spoons,

With over a decade of experience in design and product development, I was immediately intrigued by the Product Manager opening. Your company's exceptional work closely aligns with my passion for data-driven product strategy and high-growth environments. My extensive background in UX/UI design and front-end development, combined with my on-site and off-site work in Milan, has given me a unique technical foundation and user-centric perspective. I believe this would be invaluable in driving product success from day one.

Throughout my career, I have thrived in cross-functional teams, finding the optimal balance between user value and implementation feasibility—a skill that translates directly to effective product management. My design background has taught me to solve complex problems from first principles and to challenge assumptions to exceed user expectations. For example, at the Politecnico di Milano, I collaborated closely with students from various master's programs and mentored four students through their mandatory internships. These experiences honed my ability to guide teams toward shared objectives while fostering innovation.

I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my technical understanding and user empathy across Bending Spoons' diverse portfolio of products. My design experience has given me deep insight into user behavior and business model dynamics. My development background enables me to assess technical feasibility and collaborate effectively with engineering teams. I am driven by the challenge of translating user insights and market opportunities into high-impact features. I am eager to contribute to a culture that values rigorous analysis, ambitious execution, and continuous learning through iteration.

Thank you for your consideration of my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing how my experience could benefit Bending Spoons in continuing to innovate and grow its impressive portfolio of digital products.

Sincerely,
Gorazd Guštin
