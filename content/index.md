##### FRONT-END DESIGNER & DEVELOPER
# Gorazd Guštin

<section>

I am a creative front-end designer and developer with a passion for building beautiful and intuitive user experiences. With a strong foundation in both design principles and front-end technologies, I specialize in bridging the gap between design and development to create products that are both visually stunning and highly functional.

My approach is rooted in a deep understanding of user-centric design. I believe that the best digital experiences are created when thoughtful UX/UI is combined with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I am proficient in modern front-end technologies and I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.

I am particularly excited by Bending Spoons' reputation for innovation and excellence. I am confident that my unique blend of design and development skills would allow me to make a significant contribution to your team.

This website, which I designed and built from scratch, is a small demonstration of my abilities. Here you can find my portfolio, cover letter, and CV.
